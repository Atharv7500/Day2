    <h2>Cricket  Explained</h2>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played between two teams of eleven players on a circular field with a 22-yard pitch at the center. One team bats to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or by boundaries, while the other team bowls and fields to dismiss batters by methods like bowled, caught, or run out. Matches are played in formats such as Test (up to 5 days), One Day (50 overs per side), and T20 (20 overs per side). The team with the highest runs at the end wins, blending strategy, skill, patience, and bursts of athletic drama</p>
