    <h2>Baseball Explained</h2>
    <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each on a diamond-shaped field. The offensive team, or batting team, attempts to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat and running around four bases arranged in a square. The defensive team, or fielding team, tries to prevent runs by getting batters out through various methods such as strikeouts, flyouts, and force outs. A standard game consists of nine innings, with each team alternating between batting and fielding. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball is known for its strategic depth, combining individual skill with team tactics.</p>
