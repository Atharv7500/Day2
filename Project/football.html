    <h2>Football Explained</h2>
    <p>Football is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each on a rectangular field with goals at each end. Players aim to score points by moving an oval-shaped ball into the opponent's goal area. The game is played in two halves, and the team with the most points at the end wins. Football emphasizes physical strength, endurance, and strategic teamwork.</p>
