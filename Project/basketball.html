    <h2>Basketball Explained</h2>
    <p>Basketball is a team sport played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court with hoops at each end. Players aim to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop while preventing the other team from scoring in theirs. The game is played in four quarters, and the team with the most points at the end wins. Basketball emphasizes agility, coordination, and teamwork.</p>
